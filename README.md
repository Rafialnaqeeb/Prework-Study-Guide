Prework Srudy Guide Webpage. 

## Description :computer:

Hey There
I'm glad you reached my *webpage* as I created it for my  oproject as a boot camp student.
In this page you can find a short insturctions about **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  which are the most use languages in the computers.
I used a basic elemnts to build may webpage as well as functions and arrays in javaScript.
I have faced some problems such as linked my CSS to my index with exact name otherwise it wouldn't work 
and the second problem with javaScript as I deleted one leter by accedent and my code didn't work,
However once I revise it step by step with a very clear mind i found the error and fixed it.
Therfore this project might helps you to avoid must misatkes that I faced and if you could look at the code using inspect which you can find it by right click on the page or you can hit  (Ctrl+shift+I ) If you're using Windows As I do.
Finaly: the most lesone I've learned here beside how to code is *nothing impossible as long as you can focus and have the desire to learn*.
